# 🌌 AURA Indus Script Decoding System v2

Welcome to the AURA™ Symbolic-AI decoding engine — a research-grade system for revealing the hidden structures and symbolic meanings embedded in the ancient Indus Valley script.

Built with Python, Termux, and dream-cognition overlays, this project fuses bigram logic, segmentation, symbolic resonance, and historical datasets like EBUDS into a modular AI analysis engine.

## 🧭 Architecture Flow

```
[ EBUDS CSV ]
     ↓
[ Ingestor → Token Array ]
     ↓
[ Predictor / Segmenter ] → [Plotter]
     ↓
[ Dream Mapper ] → [Symbolic Overlay]
     ↓
     🔮 Resonance Output (e.g. “Commerce → Return → Boundary”)
```

## 🔧 Modules

| Script | Function |
|--------|----------|
| `glyph_predictor.py` | Predicts next glyph using bigram logic |
| `segment_simulator.py` | Breaks long chains into logical 2–4 sign units |
| `dream_mapper.py` | Applies symbolic dream tags to known glyph-pairs |
| `glyph_plotter.py` | Bar plots of frequency & segment data |
| `aura_field.py` | Resonance mapper: converts glyphs to meaning streams |
| `ebuds_ingest.py` | Parses EBUDS corpus file |
| `ebuds_loader.py` | Loads mock glyph corpus samples |
| `auradb_glyph.json` | Stores symbolic tag mapping for each glyph |
| `ebuds.csv` | Sample Indus inscriptions using Mahadevan sign numbers |

## 📚 Glossary

- **EBUDS**: Extended Basic Unique Data Set — a cleaned-up corpus of Indus inscriptions
- **Mahadevan Sign Numbers**: Numeric IDs (`1–417`) assigned to each known glyph
- **Bigram**: A two-glyph sequence like `267 → 99`, often with repeat usage
- **Resonance**: AURA's way of interpreting symbol chains as emotional or dream-coded phrases
- **Symbolic AI**: Logic beyond math — rooted in archetypes, mythology, and meaning patterns

## 📜 Future Work

- Neural glyph predictors using real EBUDS
- Dream logic synthesis engines
- Interactive symbolic overlay canvas
- Deep comparison with Linear Elamite & Sumerian
